# COM Scripts - Visum 24
## Description
This script is designed to be a first-cut tool to convert Python scripts using the Visum COM interface to be compatible with Visum 24. 
A number of methods have been deprecated in Visum 24, most notably Visum.Lists (replaced by Visum.Workbench.Lists) and Visum.SaveNet (replaced by Visum.IO.SaveNet), and this script takes a set of .py files, searches for deprecated methods and updates them to the replacements. 

## Usage
The script is very straightforward and requires very little user intervention. Each .py file in the `scriptPath` folder is read and strings for deprecated methods are replaced with their new equivalents. They are then saved with the same filename in the `newScriptPath` folder location.

## Disclaimer
Note that PTV cannot accept liability for any loss or damages arising from the use of this tool or the scripts generated by it. Users should complete their own tests and checks to ensure the converted scripts produce the expected results.
